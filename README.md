#### Repo
This Git Repo is an assignment to see how well we know aria accessibility.
#### Instructions
this assignment involves developing an HTML-only webpage that demonstrates the use of ARIA tags to improve web accessibility. The webpage should be structured and deployed using GitHub Pages.

Part 1: Creating the Webpage
Create a New Repository:

On GitHub, create a new repository named ARIA-Accessibility.
Initialize this repository with a README.md file.
Clone your new repository to your local machine.
Develop the Webpage:

Create an index.html file in your repository.
The webpage should include:
Headings (<h1>, <h2>) to structure the content.
Paragraphs (<p>) explaining the purpose of ARIA and web accessibility.
ARIA tags such as role, aria-hidden, aria-label, and aria-labelledby.
A navigation section (<nav>) with the role attribute.
An input field with an aria-label.
Comments in the code explaining the purpose of each ARIA tag used.
Part 2: Testing and Validation
Test for Accessibility:
Use browser tools or online services to test the accessibility of your webpage.
Make adjustments as necessary based on the feedback from these tools.
Part 3: Deployment and Submission
Deploy Your Webpage Using GitHub Pages:

In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the GitHub Pages section.
Select the branch you want to deploy (usually main).
Save the settings and wait for GitHub to deploy your site.
Once deployed, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is live.
Submit Your Work:

Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live site as your assignment submission.
